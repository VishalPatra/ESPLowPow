//************************************************************
// this is a simple example that uses the easyMesh library
//
// 1. blinks led once for every node on the mesh
// 2. blink cycle repeats every BLINK_PERIOD
// 3. sends a silly message to every node on the mesh at a random time between 1 and 5 seconds
// 4. prints anything it receives to Serial.print
//
//
//************************************************************

// Connect pin 1 (on the left) of the sensor to +5V
// NOTE: If using a board with 3.3V logic like an Arduino Due connect pin 1
// to 3.3V instead of 5V!
// Connect pin 2 of the sensor to whatever your DHTPIN is
// Connect pin 4 (on the right) of the sensor to GROUND
// Connect a 10K resistor from pin 2 (data) to pin 1 (power) of the sensor

// some gpio pin that is connected to an LED...
// on my rig, this is 5, change to the right number of your LED.
